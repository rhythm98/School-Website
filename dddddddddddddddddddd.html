<h3><font color="black" face="lucida bright">Established in 2000 ZOROASTRIAN CHARITABLE EDUCATION TRUST(ZCET) is registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act of 1950.<br><br>
THE ST. MARYS SCHOOL is managed and run by ZCET in a small tribal town of Dahod in Gujarat.<br><br>
It was Established in  the year 2000 by a old Parsi family settled in Dahod for more than 300 years. The kindergarten section started in 2000 and the St Mary's School Primary section started in June 2002.<br><br>
Established on the concept of Philanthropy and Universal Love for Mankind. ZCET caters to providing Quality Education with
the Best Facilities at a very minimised cost. If the name Parsi is synonymous with charity the Zoroastrian Charitable
Education trust would stand in the forefront for the same in this backward and tribal region of Dahod.<br><br>
The Trust and the School works on the Principles of Truthfulness, Charity, Skill, Endeavour and giving encouragement to
others in good deeds.<br><br>
Prophet  Zarathustra's command of "Happiness comes to him who seeks happiness for others" is followed in its true meaning
by the trust and the school managed by the trust.<br><br>
The Trust works on the motto of Good Thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds, which is also the School Motto.<br><br>
We believe the biggest strength and asset are its children, meaningful education to the child is the nucleus of all change.<br><br></h3>
