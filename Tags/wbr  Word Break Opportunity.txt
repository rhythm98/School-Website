When a word is too long, or you are afraid that the browser will break your lines at the wrong place, you can use the <wbr> element to add word break opportunities.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
XML<wbr>Http<wbr>Request Object.
Note:</b> The wbr element is not supported in IE.</p>

</body>
</html>
